# weekend3challenge

Welcome to your 3rd-weekend challenge! Full stack is pretty awesome huh? The idea that, in such a short time, you are able to spin up a full application architecture is pretty incredible.

This weekend is all about showing us that you have a handle on each of the different parts of the full stack. For this weekends challenge, you are going to create a 'TO DO' application. This is the type of application that is very common to tackle when learning a new language, which makes it extremely valuable to work through for the first time, since chances are good that at some point in your career you will tackle this type of application, but in another language.

BASE MODE
Please make sure to commit at least 15 or more times, you should have a couple commits complete before you leave on Friday.

Here are the specific components for the challenge:
Using AngularJS, create a front end experience that allows a user to create a task.
When the task is created, it should be stored inside of a database (MongoDB)
Whenever a task is created the front end should refresh to show all tasks that need to be completed.
Each task should have an option to 'Complete' or 'Delete'.
When a task is complete, its visual representation should change on the front end (for example, the background of the task container could change from gray to green, as well as the complete option 'checked off'. Each of these are accomplished in CSS, but will need to hook into logic to know whether or not the task is complete. ng-class will come in handy!)
Whether or not a task is complete should also be stored in the database.
Deleting a task should remove it both from the Front End as well as the Database.
We would recommend you spend some time thinking about how to approach this problem. Think through all the logic that will be needed prior to writing any code. Think through your Schema for Mongoose and how you will structure your data. Take your time, relax, remember that impostor syndrome is real, and that you are capable of knocking this out of the park!
Use CSS styling to move the aesthetic of the page beyond the vanilla HTML look:
Background color of the page
font family and size
text color &or background color of tasks to show whether or not they have been completed

To do list:
-[x] set up folders with files
-[x] npm init npm install expresss mongoose angular body-parser
-[x] make sure mongoose is on
-[x] set up file with appropriate files html, client, server, db (commit)
-[x] link files and test, commit
-[x] create an input field that takes in user input
-[x] store user input in an array of a database
-[x] access database
-[x] post data to dom
-[x] when client side is refresh data should remain the same
-[x] create a delete option for each task
-[] create a complete button for each task
-[] add css functioning to create feature
