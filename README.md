#MEAN Stack To-do list
I created a MEAN stack application that prompts the user to add a task onto a to-do list. This list will be updated consistently as the user continues to add items to their list. Additional features within this app allows users to check off tasks that have been completed and delete tasks that may have accidently been added/completed. I also added some CSS styling to make the application look more appealing. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions/comments.
